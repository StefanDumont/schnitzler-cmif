Over 2.500 correspondence pieces of Schnitzler are immediately accessible here:
https://schnitzler-briefe.acdh.oeaw.ac.at

And some printed editions can be accessed here:

Files are ordered based on the year of publication. 

Only correspondences of Schnitzler are in focus. So if a monograph contains letters without Schnitzler’s involvement those of third parties are usually skipped. Please feel free to add those letters or use the current file and create a revised and complete one.

One major flaw with the current setup is that multiple editions of the same letters are not collated. Neither is there a way to tell whether a letter was subsequently re-dated. One day this should be fixed.
